**Chinese Youth Leading the Innovation Tide – The Driving Force Behind National Soaring**

Good morning, everyone! It’s an honor to stand before you today to talk about something truly inspiring: the amazing energy of young people in China when it comes to innovation. If I could use just one word for our ambition, it would be: **Soaring**.

**I. Introduction: Innovation – The Youth's Energy**

We live in a fast-changing world. Competition is high, and technology is moving super fast. In this world, innovation isn't just nice to have; it's essential for any nation to succeed. And who is best to drive this? Young people! We are full of energy, curiosity, and we're not afraid to try new things. We are natural innovators.

How are Chinese youth responding? With great passion and real action. China is changing its tech story – from learning from others to leading the way. Young Chinese individuals are putting their smarts and hard work into creating new ideas, making a mark globally.

**II. Leading the Way: Youth in Tech**

Let's look at some clear examples of how young Chinese people are not just joining, but truly leading in key tech areas. They are making breakthroughs that affect the whole world.

Think about **DJI**, the top company for civilian drones. Its founder, Wang Tao, started this idea with his team when they were students. They focused deeply on core tech, like flight control. They didn't just make better drones; they created a whole new market for drones. This shows a youth spirit of being brave, striving for perfection, and turning a passion into a global business.

Then there’s **Huawei**. This big company relies on its many young R&D teams. Even when facing huge pressure from outside, these young minds kept pushing forward in areas like 5G and AI. Their strong belief in creating their own tech shows the youth spirit of hard work, daring to explore, and working well together.

Beyond these big names, young Chinese people are also showing amazing potential in new tech fields. Take **DeepSeek**, a rising star in AI language models. This team, mostly young tech experts, quickly launched powerful open-source AI models. They are breaking down tech barriers and helping advance AI for everyone. Their spirit is about open ideas, quick improvements, and the courage to challenge big international players.

And don’t forget **Cambricon**, a leader in AI chips. Founders Chen Tianshi and Chen Yunji, with other young scientists, started working on AI chips over ten years ago. Their long-term vision and hard work helped build the basic computing power for AI, filling important gaps in China. Their focus on core technology is a key sign of youth-driven innovation.

**III. Innovation in a Tough World: Chinese Tech's Exciting Story**

What makes these achievements even more impressive is the current global situation. We see more protectionism, tensions, and tech restrictions. Yet, despite these challenges, Chinese tech companies, led by young innovators, are not backing down. This continued and even faster progress, in such a tough environment, is truly exciting. They are investing heavily in their own research, showing great strength and smart planning.

This strength comes from a deep sense of purpose. Young Chinese people are driven by a strong desire to help their nation be self-reliant in technology. We want to solve big problems in society and industry, not just make money. This commitment to a bigger goal makes them even stronger against outside pressures.

Also, even with outside limits, China's internal innovation ecosystem thrives on openness and teamwork. Young talents work together, sharing knowledge. This strong internal energy helps them make breakthroughs, even in a difficult global scene. It's about using our shared power to overcome individual limits.

Finally, never giving up and learning fast from mistakes are critical. Innovation is tough, and outside problems make it even harder. But young Chinese tech innovators keep trying and learning from failures. Their willingness to quickly adjust helps them succeed in complex tech and market situations, turning problems into steps forward.

**IV. Conclusion: China Soaring, Powered by Youth**

In short, it's clear that young Chinese people are now the powerful engine driving China's great future. Through their innovations, they are not only meeting national needs but also showing China’s ability to lead and succeed in a complex world. They are proving that true innovation is not just about new tech; it’s about spirit, strength, and a firm promise to the future.

So, let me finish with this: Let youth shine in innovation, and let innovation give wings to the nation’s soaring! May every young Chinese person become a brave leader in innovation, and together, let’s write an amazing new chapter for China’s soaring future!
