**Chinese Youth Leading the Innovation Tide – The Driving Force Behind National Soaring**

Good morning, everyone! It’s an honor to speak about the inspiring energy of Chinese youth in innovation. Our ambition? In one word: **Soaring**.

**I. Introduction: Innovation – The Youth's Energy**

In today's fast-paced world, innovation is essential for any nation's success. And who are the natural drivers? Young people! We're energetic, curious, and unafraid to try new things.

Chinese youth are responding with passion. China is shifting its tech story – from learner to leader. Young minds are creating new ideas and making a global mark.

**II. Leading the Way: Youth in Tech**

Let's see how young Chinese are leading in key tech areas:

Think of **DJI**, the top civilian drone company. Founder Wang Tao and his student team didn't just improve drones; they created a new market. This shows youth's bravery and passion turned into global business.

Then there’s **Huawei**. Its young R&D teams, even under immense pressure, keep advancing in 5G and AI. Their belief in homegrown tech demonstrates youth's spirit of hard work and collaboration.

Beyond these, young Chinese excel in emerging tech. Consider **DeepSeek** in AI. This young team rapidly launched powerful open-source AI models, challenging global players and advancing AI for all. Their spirit is about openness and courage.

And **Cambricon**, an AI chip leader. Its young founders began work over a decade ago, building crucial computing power for AI and filling vital gaps for China.

**III. Innovation in a Tough World**

These achievements are even more impressive given global challenges like protectionism and tech restrictions. Yet, Chinese tech companies, driven by young innovators, are not backing down. They invest heavily in their own research, showing great strength.

This comes from a deep sense of purpose: a desire to achieve tech self-reliance and solve societal problems, not just chase profit. This commitment fuels their resilience.

Moreover, China's internal innovation ecosystem thrives on openness and teamwork. Young talents collaborate, sharing knowledge to overcome challenges. It’s our shared power overcoming limits.

Finally, resilience and fast learning are key. Innovation is tough. But young Chinese tech innovators learn from failures, quickly adapt, and turn problems into progress.

**IV. Conclusion: China Soaring, Powered by Youth**

Clearly, young Chinese are the engine driving China's future. Their innovations meet national needs and showcase China's ability to lead in a complex world. They prove innovation is about spirit, strength, and a promise to the future.

So, let youth shine in innovation, and let innovation give wings to our nation’s soaring! May every young Chinese person become a brave leader in innovation, and together, let’s write an amazing new chapter for China’s soaring future!
